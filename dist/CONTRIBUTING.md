## Style Guidelines

### JavaScript Style Guide

- Use ES6+ features where appropriate
- Use `const` and `let` instead of `var`
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations

**Example:**
```javascript
// Good
async function loadUserTasks(userId) {
  try {
    const tasks = await db.collection('tasks').where('userId', '==', userId).get();
    return tasks.docs.map(doc => ({ id: doc.id, ...doc.data() }));
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error loading tasks:', error);
    throw error;
  }
}

// Bad
function loadUserTasks(userId) {
  var tasks;
  db.collection('tasks').where('userId', '==', userId).get().then(function(snapshot) {
    tasks = snapshot.docs.map(function(doc) {
      return { id: doc.id, ...doc.data() };
    });
  });
  return tasks; // This won't work!
}
```

### CSS Style Guide

- Use CSS variables for colors and common values
- Follow BEM naming convention where applicable
- Keep selectors specific but not overly complex
- Group related properties together
- Add comments for complex styles

**Example:**
```css
/* Good */
.task-card {
  background-color: var(--card);
  border-radius: var(--border-radius);
  padding: 20px;
  transition: var(--transition);
}

.task-card__title {
  font-size: 1.2rem;
  font-weight: 700;
  color: var(--text);
}

/* Bad */
.task-card {
  background-color: #ffffff;
  padding: 20px;
  font-size: 1.2rem;
  border-radius: 16px;
  color: #2d3436;
  font-weight: 700;
  transition: all 0.3s ease;
}
```

### HTML Style Guide

- Use semantic HTML5 elements
- Keep markup clean and well-indented
- Add appropriate ARIA labels for accessibility
- Use meaningful class names

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
